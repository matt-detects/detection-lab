# detection-lab

This repository serves as an index of hands-on detection engineering and security automation projects.

My focus areas include:

- Log parsing and normalization
- Python-based enrichment workflows
- API integration
- Regex-based detection logic
- MITRE ATT&CK alignment
- Detection rule development and tuning

The goal is to build practical detection engineering skills with clean, modular code.

## Projects

### Log Parsing Lab
Practical JSON and raw log parsing using Python and regex.
- Structured extraction of key fields
- CSV normalization
- Named capture groups
- Pattern-based event parsing
 
Repo: https://github.com/matt-detects/log-parsing

---

### API Enrichment Lab
Python-based enrichment workflows using REST APIs.
- IP reputation lookups
- JSON parsing
- Error handling
- Structured output formatting

Repo: https://github.com/matt-detects/API-enrichment

---

### Sigma Detection Rules
Detection rule development aligned to MITRE ATT&CK.
- ATT&CK technique mapping
- Rule documentation
- False-positive considerations

Repo: https://github.com/matt-detects/sigma-rules

---

## Approach

These labs are focused on practical detection engineering skills:

- Writing clean, modular Python
- Building enrichment pipelines
- Improving signal quality
- Reducing false positives
- Thinking in terms of detection lifecycle

All projects use synthetic or publicly available data.

More projects will be added as development continues.
